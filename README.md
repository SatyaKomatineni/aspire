2. Automatic B2B and B2C
3. Declarative Read and write APIs
4. Programmatic Read and write APIs
5. Java procedures with automatic commit/rollbacks
6. Graduate friendly
7. Full backward compatibility across builds
8. Computational Logic = Declarative (or)/(and) Procedural (or/and) functional (or/and) OOP
